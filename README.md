# Transition to React

The project you see represents my old portfolio, developed using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Here are a few reasons why I decided to transition to React:

* **Dynamism and Interactivity:** Static HTML and CSS limit the capabilities of creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React allows creating components that can dynamically update based on data changes and user interactions.

* **Component-based Architecture:** React's component-based architecture makes it easier to manage and organize code, especially as the project grows in complexity. Each component can be designed to encapsulate its logic and behavior.

* **Efficient DOM Manipulation:** React's virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithm minimize DOM manipulation, resulting in better performance and faster rendering compared to traditional methods.

* **Rich Ecosystem:** React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support, making it easier to find solutions to common problems and integrate with other technologies.

With these advantages in mind, I made the decision to migrate to React for improved development efficiency, code maintainability, and enhanced user experience.

Feel free to explore the codebase to see how I implemented various features using these technologies.
